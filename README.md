# Quick-Quiz
In this project, we'll build a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz app will present the user with multiple-choice questions to answer, display a progress bar to track their progress, and store their scores in a local database using browser storage (such as localStorage).

Features:

Question Presentation: Display multiple-choice questions to the user, allowing them to select an answer.
Progress Bar: Show a progress bar indicating the user's progress through the quiz.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.
Local Database: Store the user's scores locally in the browser using localStorage or IndexedDB.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the quiz interface and displaying questions and options.
CSS: Utilized for styling the elements, including the layout, colors, fonts, and progress bar.
JavaScript: Implemented for handling user interactions, fetching questions, calculating scores, updating the UI dynamically, and storing data in the local database.
Project Implementation:

HTML Structure: Create the structure of the quiz app, including elements for displaying questions, options, progress bar, and score.
CSS Styling: Apply styles to the elements to create an attractive and user-friendly interface, including layout, colors, fonts, and progress bar design.
JavaScript Functionality:
Fetch quiz questions from a predefined set or an external data source.
Display questions and options dynamically.
Handle user interactions such as selecting an answer and moving to the next question.
Calculate the user's score based on their answers.
Update the progress bar to reflect the user's progress through the quiz.
Store the user's score locally in the browser's database (localStorage or IndexedDB).
Local Database Integration:
Implement functions to store and retrieve scores from the local database.
Update the UI to display the user's score at the end of the quiz.
Testing: Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected, including answering questions, progress tracking, and score storage.
Deployment: Deploy the quiz app to a web hosting platform so that users can access it online.
Conclusion:
By creating a quiz app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a progress bar and local database integration, we've developed an interactive and engaging application for users to test their knowledge. This project demonstrates the use of front-end technologies to build functional web applications with dynamic features and data storage capabilities.
